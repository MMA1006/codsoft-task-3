# Codsoft Task 3 - Image Captioning AI

## Overview
This project implements an Image Captioning AI using Streamlit and Hugging Face's transformers. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to automatically generate descriptive captions for uploaded images, making use of pre-trained models such as VGG or ResNet for feature extraction.

## Features
- Upload an image to generate a caption.
- Utilizes state-of-the-art models from Hugging Face for image recognition and caption generation.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/MMA1006/codsoft-task-3.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd codsoft-task-3
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the application.

How It Works
Image Upload: Users can upload an image via the web interface.
Feature Extraction: The application uses a pre-trained model (like VGG or ResNet) to extract features from the uploaded image.
Caption Generation: A transformer-based model processes the extracted features to generate a descriptive caption for the image.
